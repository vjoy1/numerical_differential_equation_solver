Numerical Differential Equation Solver

Overview

This repository provides a collection of numerical methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ranging from basic techniques to more advanced methods such as quadrature. Our goal is to build a comprehensive and efficient solver that can handle a wide variety of differential equations commonly encountered in mathematical and computational research.
